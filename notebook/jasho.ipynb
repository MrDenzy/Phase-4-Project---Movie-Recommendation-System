Effective personalization helps users discover relevant content efficiently while improving engagement and satisfaction.\n",
    "This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using historical user rating data from the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)\n",
    " (ml-latest-small) dataset. The system applies collaborative filtering as the primary recommendation mechanism, supplemented by content-based filtering using movie genre information to address cold-start scenarios and improving engagement, satisfaction, and content discovery efficiency."

Without effective personalization, users may struggle to discover relevant content, leading to reduced satisfaction and platform usage. The challenge is to leverage historical user ratings to generate accurate and personalized movie recommendations."
